4. Now you are ready to continue.<a href="https://spl.solana.com/token#example-creating-your-own-fungible-token" target="_blank">Follow the guide to create Fungible Tokens</a>



💡 Record the end time. How long did it take?

### Tips:

- If you don't remember the Tokens you created with your keypair, do the following command: `spl-token accounts` 
- Check that you are currently using devnet network 👀
- Be careful when selecting your Token ID and your Associated Token Account

### Q/A

q1: Transaction ID of transferring 1.000.000 Fungible Tokens

a1: [a valid Transaction ID with `5QDcRHpEfDvCT9Ku3yaC8h9GYvDmsLGmq9FQZYh6Vd5` as recipient]

q2: Transaction ID of transferring 1 Non Fungible Token

a2: [a valid Transaction ID with `5QDcRHpEfDvCT9Ku3yaC8h9GYvDmsLGmq9FQZYh6Vd5` as recipient]

q3: What is an Associated Token Account and why do we need to create it before transferring tokens to an address? 

a3: An Associated Token Account is the result of deriving a token account key from a user's main System account address and a token mint address, allowing the user to create a main token account for each token they own. In simple words, an Associated Token Account is an account that references our wallet + Token ID , creating an account to hold this specific token.
