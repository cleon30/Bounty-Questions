q2: Transaction ID of transferring 1 Non Fungible Token

a2: [a valid Transaction ID with `5QDcRHpEfDvCT9Ku3yaC8h9GYvDmsLGmq9FQZYh6Vd5` as recipient]

q3: What is an Associated Token Account and why do we need to create it before transferring tokens to an address? 

a3: An Associated Token Account is the result of deriving a token account key from a user's main System account address and a token mint address, allowing the user to create a main token account for each token they own. In simple words, an Associated Token Account is an account that references our wallet + Token ID , creating an account to hold this specific token.
